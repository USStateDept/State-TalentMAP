By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

See the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) documentation for more details.

## Accessibility

Accessibility tests can be run in a CI environment using `pa11y-ci`. By default, it tests the URL array found in `.pa11yci` using the WCAG 2.0 AA standard. Be sure to update the array of URLs with IDs that exist in your environment's database.
